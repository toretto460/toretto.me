== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: After enabling the settings, my site doesn't have any style, it's just text. Why?
A: Your site can't find your theme files, be sure you've uploaded them to Dropbox, and preserved any folder structure it contained.

Q: Is this an official Dropbox plugin?
A: No, I am in no way affiliated with Dropbox.

== Changelog ==
--1.1--
Added support for 'stylesheet_url'

--1.0--
First release

== Description ==
Allows you to upload your themes CSS, JavaScript, and Images into your Dropbox 'Public' folder and server these files from the Dropbox network, reducing the bandwidth of your server and allowing users to load your site faster. Please note that as of now, this plugin only supports themes who use the filters 'template_directory', 'template_directory_uri', 'stylesheet_directory', and 'stylesheet_directory_uri' to determine the paths to the theme's template and stylesheet files. I would only suggest this plugin for users who aren't afraid of getting their hands a little diry.

This plugin is in no way affiliated with Dropbox.
